# budget_app

Budget App helps you track your expenses and incomes. The minimalist approach does not distract you from the main focus either adding entries or checking insights interacting with a clean and simple interface.

The best way to manage personal money is to enter every expense you've made manually. Adding next utility, groceries, subscription, or snacks expense you think: "Is it possible to get rid of this purchase in my future bill?". This is one of the important steps in personal money management.

The insights screen is designed to be simple but pretty powerful: check your spending by weekly, monthly, and yearly periods. It helps understand when you spent more than expected and when follow your budget's rules.

Initially, the app was made based on the spreadsheet's point of view. You can notice the common traits between Budget App and Google Sheets, Excel, Numbers, Notion tables in design. The basics were kept and all the power of charts was added.

Be your personal finance manager and take control of your money, wisely plan your budgets, use the app on daily basis and you will see good results in the near future.
